So you're working on something really important, but you can't take your eyes off Reddit. You start doing your work, but instead of searching for something, your fingers type in "reddit.com" in the URL bar, and now you're looking at cat pictures again!

What if there was a way to block some websites while working on really important stuff? Something like this: http://i.imgur.com/x1IBWUJ.gifv
